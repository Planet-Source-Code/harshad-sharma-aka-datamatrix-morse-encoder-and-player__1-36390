' WHODUNNIT:
'   The whole code presented here is written by    : Harshad Sharma
'   If you want to use the code in your project, a brief mention of
'   it's original creator would be appreciated :-)
'   You might like to include a little line like this:
'   "Basic program by Harshad Sharma | email: harshad.sharma@bigfoot.com | homepage: www20.brinkster.com/tanhadil"
'   That is all I want!
'
' WHAT IT DOES:
'   1. Takes in a string of charachers
'   2. Encodes it into a series of dots (.) and dashes (-) based on
'      International Morse Code
'   3. Plays back the sound (dah-di-dit) from the computer speaker
'
' PURPOSE: To provide a template for building CW apps
'   Basically intended for those interested in HAM.
'   This code is just an example showing ease of programming in VB
'
' TO-DO: There are several things that still have to be implemented...
'    1. Generate sound through soundcard (on bigger speakers)
'    2. Make a full-fledged transmission app.
'    3. I am currently working on a project to decode the Morse Code!
